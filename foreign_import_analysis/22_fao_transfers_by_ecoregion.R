# Convert incoming land transfers from each country to incoming land transfers from ecoregions
# QDR / Virtualland / 17 Feb 2021

# Modified 18 Feb 2021: do separately for the 20 scenarios

# Needed: incoming virtual cropland and pastureland countries by country
# Needed: total area of cropland and pastureland in each ecoregion in each country
